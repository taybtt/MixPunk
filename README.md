## Repository Structure

### Discussion Logs
Discussions will be held whenever there are enough discussion points in the [[Discussion Points for the Next Discussion]] file. This section of the repository will allow the game designers to go back to the decisions made in the past.

### Terminology
This file will be used to store the various terminology used in the game. This file is important to use as reference while writing new descriptions of the game parts as keeping the game terminology the same is a considerable improvement for how user-friendly a game's description is.
