there should be different combat mechanics and each of them can be from any punk. each punk will have a related combat option

Options:
Melee:
Ranged:
Spells:
Staff:
Pets:
Armor:
Tome:
Items/Books

a staff allows you to cast cantrips as attacks
a weapon allows you to make a weapon attack as attacks
there will be a specific skill in the gish tree or the ranger tree for ranged that allows you to cast cantrips like booming blade with the weapons or smites and shit.
you will be able to open a spells tab that allows you to stop the time with a time limit until you place your spell.

have classes, stereotypes (like gish), and suclasses (specific to each punk.)
